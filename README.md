# Fake News Detection

This repository contains a Streamlit application for detecting fake news using a PassiveAggressiveClassifier model. The application allows users to input news articles and predicts whether they are real or fake.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning application for fake news detection. It uses a machine learning algorithm to classify news articles as real or fake based on their text content. The model is trained on a dataset of news articles, where each article is labeled as either real or fake. The training process involves learning patterns and features from the text of these articles that help distinguish between real and fake news.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- streamlit

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn joblib streamlit

##Usage 

Run the main.py file in your terminal by using command:
```sh
streamlit run main.py
